# Project description
It is a web store created for *testing* purposes only! Initially I was planning to make it full-organized and be able to interact with other services like FB, Twitter etc. and create AI for recommendation system as well. But things went differently and now I am using it as a tester only.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Iaroslavv/WebStore.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And you're ready to go!
